### pyrecipes

A tool to scrape recipes from popular websites and convert them into usable formats like json, yaml etc. 

### Motivation

I use [paprika](https://paprikaapp.com) and it only supports importing of recipes via yaml. I was tired of manually 
downloading recipes and pasting in paprika from Hello Fresh. After writing a scraper for Hello Fresh I would like it
to be extensible for other recipe sites.
